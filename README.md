#  Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A clean and simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This was my first mini-project to practice front-end web development fundamentals.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **HTML:** For the basic structure and layout.
* **CSS:** For styling, including the game board and player turn indicators.
* **JavaScript :** For all the game logic, including:
    * Handling user clicks (Event Listeners)
    * Updating the game board (DOM Manipulation)
    * Checking for win/draw conditions
    * Resetting the game
    * disabling each button after clicking it once

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Classic 3x3 game board.
* Tracks the current player (X or O).
* Correctly identifies win conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
* Announces the winner or a draw.
* A "Reset Game" button to start a new game.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was a great way to solidify my understanding of core JavaScript concepts. The biggest takeaways for me were:

* **DOM Manipulation:** I learned how to select elements and dynamically change them based on user interaction.
* **Game Logic:** Implementing the algorithm to check for a winner was a ok but implementing the algorithm to draw the game is challenging for me
* **Event Handling:** I got hands-on practice using event listeners to make the board interactive.
